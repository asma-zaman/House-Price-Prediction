# House-Price-Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict house prices based on various features of the house. The goal of this project is to provide a tool that can estimate the selling price of a house given its characteristics.

Features
Dataset: The model is trained on a dataset that includes various features such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, and other relevant attributes that influence house prices.

Models Used: Several machine learning algorithms are explored and compared to find the most accurate predictor for house prices. Here I have used linear regression, decision trees, random forests. Most accurate one was random forests.

Evaluation: The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to measure how well the model predicts house prices.
